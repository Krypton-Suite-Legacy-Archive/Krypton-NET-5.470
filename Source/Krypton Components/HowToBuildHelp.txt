What:
- The help content is a combination of code trawling and Mardown files.


Applications:
- The Help files are built via DocFX, Download the latest from "https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases"
- Unzip to your favourite location
- Get a good Markdown editor (Either inside visual studio, or standalone - "e.g. MarkDownPad 2")


Help Files:
- Edit the md file(s) [in the "DocFX\articles" subdirectory] to reflect the content, and add the pictures into the images directory.
- If new content is added then update the yml index files.


Buid:
- Open a command line at the Help directory
- copy in the location of the DocFX.exe
- copy the following onto the end of the command line to "build" and then "serve" html help generated
- - docfx\docfx.json --serve
- e.g 
- - >>Z:\\Krypton-NET-4.7\Help>Z:\DocFX\docfx.exe docfx\docfx.json --serve
- Now you can view the generated website on http://localhost:8080.


Fixing:
- If you have any Red or yellow text in the build output, then you will need to edit the files referenced and rebuild.
