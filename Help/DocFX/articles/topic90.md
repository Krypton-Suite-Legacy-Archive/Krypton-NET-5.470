Ribbon ButtonSpecs

Use *ButtonSpec* definitions when you need to add additional buttons to the left
or right side of the ribbon tabs. Figure 1 shows an example of the ribbon with a
*ButtonSpec* defined for the *Near* side with the text *Spec1* and a
*ButtonSpec* defined for the *Far* side called *Spec2*. You are not limited to
just using text and can use any combination of text and *Image* properties. For
a more detailed explanation of all the different *ButtonSpec* properties see
this [link](buttonspec.md).

**ButtonSpecs**  
The *ButtonSpecs* property is a collection of individual *ButtonSpec* instances.
To add, remove or modify the entries you should click the property and then use
the presented ellipses button to open the standard collection editor. Note that
some changes you make inside the collection editor will not update the ribbon
control until you leave by using the *OK* button.
