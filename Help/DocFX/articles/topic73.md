**Group Item Cluster**  
A cluster item can be added as a child of a group lines container but cannot be
added to any other type of container. It has no user interface of its own but
instead acts as a container for cluster button items. Note that this cluster
item cannot be added as a child of a group. Figure 1 shows the properties for
the cluster item.
