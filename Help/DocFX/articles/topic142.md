Tutorial – 3 Pane Application

 

**1) Create a new Windows Forms project**  


This will automatically create a form in design mode as below.

 

 

 

 

**2) Add a reference to the ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit assembly**  
  
**C\#** : Right click the 'References' group in your project and select the 'Add
Reference...' option. Use the 'Browse' tab of the shown dialog box to navigate
to the location you installed the library and choose the
'\\bin\\ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit.dll' file. This will then add the
toolkit assembly to the list of references for the project.  
  
*VB.NET* : Right click the project in the 'Solution Explorer' window and choose
the 'Add Reference' option. Use the 'Browse' tab of the shown dialog box to
navigate to the location you installed the library and choose the
'\\bin\\ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit.dll' file. This will then add the
toolkit assembly to the list of references for the project.

 

**3) Ensure that the Krypton Toolkit components are in the Toolbox**  
If not the [Using Krypton in VS2017](Using%20Krypton%20in%20VS2017.md)
tutorial can be used to add them.

 

 

**4) Open the code view for the form and change the base class.**  


Change the base class from the default of 'Form' to be
'ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit.KryptonForm'. Your new definition for C\#
would be: -

public partial class Form1 : ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit.KryptonForm

If using VB.NET then your new definition should like this: -

Partial Class Form1  
    Inherits ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit.KryptonForm

Recompile the project and then show the form in design mode again, this time you
should see custom chrome applied to the form.

 

 

 

**5) Drag a MenuStrip from the toolbox and drop it on the form**  


This will automatically dock itself to the top of the form.

 

 

  
**6) Use the MenuStrip smart tag and click ‘Insert Standard Items’**  


Click the small box on the top right of the MenuStrip to open the smart tag.

 

 

**7) Drag a ToolStrip from the toolbox and drop it on the form**  
This will automatically dock itself underneath the MenuStrip

 

**8) Use the ToolStrip smart tag and click ‘Embed in ToolStripContainer’**  
This will create a box with four edge markers and a tool bar area at the top.

 

 

 

**9) Drag a StatusStrip from the toolbox and drop it on the form**  
This will automatically be docked to the bottom of the form as shown here.

 

 

 

 

**10) Use the StatusStrip smart tag and change the 'RenderMode' to
‘ManagerRenderMode'**  
By default the StatusStrip uses the system renderer but Krypton needs to have
all tool strips use the global ToolStripManager renderer in order to ensure a
consistent look and feel across all the strips. So we change the rendering mode
to ensure the consistent appearance.

 

 

 

**11) Use the properties window to select the 'toolStripContainer1'**  
You cannot select the tool strip container by clicking on the container itself
in the designer and so we need to use the properties window to manually cause
the selection to change. Once selected you will notice the designer view change
to show the entire tool strip container selected with the smart tag button
displayed.

 

 

**12) Use the ToolStripContainer smart tag and select ‘Dock Fill in Form'**  
We do this so the container takes up all the space left over after positioning
the menu and status strips.

 

 

**13) Select the tool strip and use the smart tag to select 'Insert Standard
Items'**  
Click the small box on the top right of the ToolStrip to open the smart tag.

** **  
  
  
**14) Click center of the client area then use properties window to set
'RenderMode' to 'ManagerRenderMode'**  
By default the content panel in the center of the tool strip container uses the
system renderer but Krypton needs to have all tool strips use the global
ToolStripManager renderer in order to ensure a consistent look and feel across
all areas. So we change the rendering mode to ensure the consistent appearance.

 

 

You should now have the following appearance which is the starting point for
building the specific functionality of this tutorial.

 

 

**15) Modify the Padding property for the ‘toolStripContainer1.ContentPanel’ to
5 on all sides**

You should still have the content panel of the tool strip container selected in
the properties window, if not then just click in the center of the client area
and the content panel will be selected again. Then alter the padding property as
shown here. This adds padding around the four form edges otherwise all the
panels would be placed hard against the edges.

  
** **

**16) Drag a KryptonSplitContainer from the toolbox and drop it inside the
KryptonPanel**  
You should see text indicating the position of Panel1 and Panel2 areas.

   
 

**17) Drag a KryptonSplitContainer from the toolbox and drop it inside the area
marked ‘Pane2’**  


There will now be two areas marked as Panel1 but only one marked as Panel2.

 

 

  
**18) Use the smart tag for the second KryptonSplitContainer and click
‘Horizontal splitter orientation’**

This will switch the splitter from being vertical to horizontal in direction.

 

 

**19) Drag a KryptonHeaderGroup from the toolbox and drop onto the left most
‘Panel1’**  


The first pane needs a top and bottom header so we use a KryptonHeaderGroup.
Once dropped you will need to use the smart tag of the header group in order to
select the 'Dock in parent container' so that it fills the entire 'Panel1' area
it was dropped into.

 

   
  
 

**20) Drag a KryptonHeaderGroup from the toolbox and drop onto the top most
‘Panel1’** 

The second pane needs one header so we still need to use a KryptonHeaderGroup.
Once dropped you will need to use the smart tag of the header group in order to
select the 'Dock in parent container' so that it fills the entire 'Panel1' area
it was dropped into.

 

   
  
 

**21) Use the smart tag for the second KryptonHeaderGroup and click ‘Hide
secondary header’**

We remove the bottom header from being displayed.

 

   
  
 

**22) Drag a KryptonGroup from the toolbox and drop onto the ‘Panel2’ area** 

The third pane does not need any headers so a KryptonGroup is used. Once dropped
you will need to use the smart tag of the group in order to select the 'Dock in
parent container' so that it fills the entire 'Panel2' area it was dropped into.

 

   
 

  
**23) Modify the ‘StateCommon -\> Back -\> Color1’ property to ‘AppWorkspace’**  
We want the padding area to be distinctive and so change the color.

  
  
**24) Modify the Padding property for the new kryptonGroup1.Panel to 5 on all
sides**  


Click on the center of the new group to select the kryptonGroup1.Panel control.
This is the Panel instance that is positioned inside the border of the group.
Once the panel is selected set the border to 5 by using the properties window as
can be seen below.

 

**25) Drag a KryptonGroup from the toolbox and drop into the existing
KryptonGroup**

 

   
  
 

**26) Use the smart tag for the KryptonGroup and click ‘Dock in parent
container’**

We need the content panel to always fill the entire available area.

 

 

  
**27) Select the ‘kryptonHeaderGroup1’ instance in the properties window**  


 

**27) Set the ‘ValuesPrimary -\> Image’ property to (none)**  


We do not want the left pane to have an image in our example.

 

**29) Select the ‘kryptonHeaderGroup2’ instance in the properties window**  


 

  
  
**30) Modify the ‘StateCommon -\> HeaderPrimary -\> Content -\> Image –\>
ImageH’ property to be ‘Far’**  


By default the image appears on the left, we want to reverse this to the
opposite side.

 

  
  
**31) Select the ‘kryptonSplitContainer1’ instance in the properties window**

 

**32) Modify the ‘FixedPanel’ property to be ‘Panel1’**  


Now resizing the main form will not change the size of left pane.

 

  
**33) Compile and run the application**  


At runtime you should be able to resize the main form and notice that the left
pane stays a constant width as the right hand panes are modified. The top and
bottom panes on the right hand side will retain the same relative sizing as the
height of the form is changed.
