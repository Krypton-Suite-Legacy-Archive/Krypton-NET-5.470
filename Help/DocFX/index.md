# Introduction
The `Krypton Suite` contains user interface components designed to make it quick and easy for developers to create professional looking applications. It provides the essential building blocks needed to create a consistent look and feel across all your products. You can use the built-in palettes to achieve the same appearance as industry standard applications such as _Microsoft Office 2007/2010/2013/365_. Alternatively you can create your own custom palettes to create a completely unique user interface.
The `Krypton Suite` consists of five products called `Krypton Toolkit, Krypton Ribbon, Krypton Navigator, Krypton Workspace` and `Krypton Docking`.

* Modifications by Peter Wagner (aka Wagnerp) & Simon Coghlan (aka Smurf-IV)  have been fixing and adding more capabilities to this toolkit.
* There is also an Extensions project, which takes these base controls and add more useful complete controls (Currently outside the scope of this help)
* All new releases of packages will no longer ship with the '.chm' help file. This is to reduce file size from 70+ MB to 5 - 6 MB.
* All .Net Versions from 4.50 are catered for with some back-merges for 4.0
* New versions of Nuget packages can be obtained via [this link](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=KryptonToolkitSuite5/), or via your package manager by searching `KryptonToolkitSuite5`.
