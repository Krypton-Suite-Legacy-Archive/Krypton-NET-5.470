# Introduction
The `Krypton Suite` contains user interface components designed to make it quick and easy for developers to create professional looking applications. It provides the essential building blocks needed to create a consistent look and feel across all your products. You can use the built-in palettes to achieve the same appearance as industry standard applications such as _Microsoft Office 2007/2010/2013_. Alternatively you can create your own custom palettes to create a completely unique user interface.
The `Krypton Suite` consists of five products called `Krypton Toolkit, Krypton Ribbon, Krypton Navigator, Krypton Workspace` and `Krypton Docking`.

Using the `Krypton Toolkit` you can create a great looking application in just minutes. 
 

## Krypton Ribbon
The `Krypton Ribbon` is designed to mimic the look, feel and operation of the ribbon control seen in the _Microsoft Office 2007/2010/2013_ applications such as _Word_ and _Excel_. It provides advanced capabilities including the quick access toolbar, contextual tabs and auto shrinking groups. With rich design time support and sample code you can be up and running with the ribbon in no time at all. It integrates with the `Krypton Toolkit` architecture to ensure a consistent look and feel. 


## Krypton Navigator

It integrates with the `Krypton Toolkit` architecture to ensure a consistent look and feel.
 
## Krypton Workspace
The `Krypton Workspace` allows a document area to be created that the user can customize by dragging and dropping pages into new positions.

It integrates with the Krypton Toolkit architecture to ensure a consistent look and feel.
 
## Krypton Docking
The `Krypton Docking` set of components allow the user to drag and drop docking pages into new locations in order to customize the organization of the application content. It allows this in a way similar to that of Visual Studio 2008/2010. Each docking area uses an instance of the `Krypton Workspace` allowing a wide range of options for organizing and displaying pages. It integrates with the `Krypton Toolkit` architecture to ensure a consistent look and feel.
