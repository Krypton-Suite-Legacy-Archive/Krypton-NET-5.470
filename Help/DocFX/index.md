# Introduction
The `Krypton Suite` contains user interface components designed to make it quick and easy for developers to create professional looking applications. It provides the essential building blocks needed to create a consistent look and feel across all your products. You can use the built-in palettes to achieve the same appearance as industry standard applications such as _Microsoft Office 2007/2010/2013/365_. Alternatively you can create your own custom palettes to create a completely unique user interface.
The `Krypton Suite` consists of five products called `Krypton Toolkit, Krypton Ribbon, Krypton Navigator, Krypton Workspace` and `Krypton Docking`.
