<p>Control Structure</p>
<p>All of the <em>Krypton</em> controls follow the same basic structure in the
organization of properties and how features are exposed. Once you understand the
standard organization you can quickly find and customize the control feature of
interest. Figure 1 shows the set of properties exposed by the <em>KryptonButton</em>
control that will be used as the example for the rest of this section.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1 – KryptonButton standard properties</em></p>
<p>Notice that the entire standard set of properties are grouped together under the
category name of <em>Visuals</em>. If you ensure your properties window in <em>Visual
Studio</em> is organized by category then it becomes very easy to find this group.</p>
<p>Not all <em>Krypton</em> properties are exposed by this category, only the standard
set. For example the <em>KryptonSplitContainer</em> has a <em>SplitterWidth</em> property that
is placed in the <em>Layout</em> category. This maintains consistency with the property
of the same name that is also in the <em>Layout</em> category for the <em>Windows Forms
SplitContainer</em> control.</p>
<p><strong>Styles</strong> </p>
<p>Each type of control has multiple styles that are used to determine how the
control will be displayed. This style value is exposed as an enumeration
property and in the case of our <em>KryptonButton</em> example it is called
<em>ButtonStyle</em>. The different styles can be thought of as the different
variations available for that control.</p>
<p>In the case of the <em>KryptonButton</em> the <em>Standalone</em> style is used for a standard
button that is appropriate for most situations. The <em>LowProfile</em> style is
instead intended for use in scenarios where the button should blend into the
background of the container until the user interacts with it by giving it focus
for moving the mouse over it. Figure 2 shows an example of the button using each
of these two styles.  </p>
<p><em>Figure 2 – ButtonStyle examples</em></p>
<p>The first column shows the <em>Standalone</em> and <em>LowProfile</em> styles when the button
is passive. You can see that the second button style has a transparent
background in order to be less intrusive. In the second column you can see that
when the user moves the mouse over the buttons they both then become highlighted
in the same way.  </p>
<p>A third button style of <em>ButtonSpec</em> is used for buttons when they are placed
inside of other <em>Krypton</em> controls and the fourth style of <em>Form</em> is for caption
buttons that are used by the <em>KryptonForm</em>. There are also extra custom styles
that can be defined by using the KryptonPalette component. These extra styles
always start with the word &#39;Custom&#39; and end with a number. In the case of button
styles there are three with the names <em>Custom1</em>, <em>Custom2</em> and <em>Custom3</em>. Styles
for different controls have a differing number of custom entries available.</p>
<p><strong>Palette</strong> </p>
<p>When any of the <em>Krypton</em> controls is drawn the details are sourced from a
palette that contains all the default values for all of the different controls.
This allows you to quickly switch the appearance of the controls by switching to
using a different palette. Note that the palette is used to recover the values
to use when they have not been customized at the per control level. See details
of the <em>State</em> and <em>Override</em> properties for more details about customizing an
individual control.</p>
<p>Each control has two properties called <em>Palette</em> and <em>PaletteMode</em> that define
which palette to use. <em>PaletteMode</em> determines how to find the palette. The
default value is called <em>Global</em> and means that the control will use the single
global palette. Most applications want all of the <em>Krypton</em> controls to have a
consistent look and feel. In order to support this scenario there is a global
palette setting. If you change the global palette then all the controls with a
<em>PaletteMode</em> of <em>Global</em> will automatically start using this new value.</p>
<p>To change the global palette you need to add an instance of the <em>KryptonManager</em>
component to your application and then modify the <em>GlobalPaletteMode</em> and
<em>GlobalPalette</em> properties. You can do this at design time by just dragging the
<em>KryptonManager</em> component from the <em>Toolbox</em> and dropping it on your <em>Form</em>.
Then select the new component and search in the properties window for the
<em>GlobalPaletteMode</em> and <em>GlobalPalette</em> properties.</p>
<p>Instead of using the <em>Global</em> value you might prefer to specify one of the
built-in palettes for use with the control instance. In this case you just need
to select one of the entries such as <em>Professional - System</em> and the control
will then be fixed to using that built-in palette.</p>
<p>You are not limited to using just built-in palettes. If you use a
<em>KryptonPalette</em> component in your application then you can create your own
custom palette with whatever settings you like. Just drag and drop the
<em>KryptonPalette</em> from the <em>Toolbox</em> onto your <em>Form</em> and then use the properties
window to setup the custom values. In order to modify your control to use the
custom palette you need to use the <em>Palette</em> property of the <em>Krypton</em> control.
Once assigned, which can be done at design time using the properties window, the
<em>PaletteMode</em> value will automatically change to <em>Custom</em>. Figure 3 shows three
<em>KryptonButton</em> instances where the first two are using built-in palettes of
<em>Professional - Office 2003</em> and <em>Professional - System</em> and the third is using
a <em>KryptonPalette</em> that has been customized.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3 – KryptonButton with different palettes</em></p>
<p><strong>Renderer</strong> </p>
<p>All control drawing is performed by a renderer. Unlike the palette you cannot
alter the renderer used on a per control basis but instead can only alter it at
the global level. To change the global renderer you need to add an instance of
the <em>KryptonManager</em> component to your application and then modify the
<em>GlobalRenderMode</em> and <em>GlobalRenderer</em> properties. You can do this at design
time by just dragging the <em>KryptonManager</em> component from the <em>Toolbox</em> and
dropping it on your <em>Form</em>. Then select the new component and use the properties
window to change the settings.</p>
<p><strong>State</strong> </p>
<p>Each control has a number of properties that begin with the word <em>State</em>, such
as <em>StateDisabled</em> and <em>StateNormal</em>. These are the properties you use to
customize the appearance of the control based on the state of the control.</p>
<p>Each control has the two states <em>Disabled</em> and <em>Normal</em>. Some controls have
additional states, for example the <em>KryptonButton</em> also has <em>Tracking</em> and
<em>Pressed</em> states which have matching customization properties of <em>StateTracking</em>
and <em>StatePressed</em>. To work out when each state is applied you should refer to
the help documentation for the particular control.</p>
<p>The <em>KryptonButton</em> uses the states in the following way. If the control is
disabled because the <em>Enabled</em> property is defined as <em>False</em> then it uses the
<em>StateDisabled</em> values. When the control is enabled but the user is not
interacting with it then it uses <em>StateNormal</em>. Once the mouse moves over the
control area it uses <em>StateTracking</em> and if the user presses the mouse down
whilst hovering over the control is uses <em>StatePressed</em>. By altering the
appropriate state values you can easily achieve the look required for your
application. Figure 4 shows an example of the appearance for each of the states
for the <em>KryptonButton</em>.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4 – KryptonButton states</em></p>
<p>Having the ability to alter each state is great for customization but can lead
to slow development if you need to alter the same property for each of the
states. For example, changing the border width is something you will probably
want to be consistent across all the states.</p>
<p>Changing the border width for <em>StateDisabled</em>, <em>StateNormal</em>, <em>StateTracking</em>
and <em>StatePressed</em> is tedious and prone to errors. This is where the extra
<em>StateCommon</em> property comes into play. This extra property acts as a common
base that all the other states use if they have not been given a value. In our
example you just set the border width of <em>StateCommon</em> and all the states will
inherit this value, unless you specifically set a value for one of the specific
states.</p>
<p><strong>Override</strong> </p>
<p>Some controls such as the <em>KryptonButton</em> need to alter the appearance of a
state because of an external factor. For example, a button is capable of having
the focus because the user can select it using the keyboard. In this case we
need to give the user feedback so they can see it has the focus.</p>
<p>Properties that are applied to the current state based on an external factor
such as the focus begin with the word <em>Override</em>. The <em>KryptonButton</em> has two
such properties called <em>OverrideFocus</em> and <em>OverrideDefault</em>. In addition to
focus the button can also be marked as the default button on the owning <em>Form</em>.
The user needs feedback on this state because pressing the <em>Enter</em> key will
cause the default button to be pressed.</p>
<p>The <em>Override</em> properties differ from <em>State</em> properties in that they do not
inherit values from <em>StateCommon</em> and are applied to whatever the current state
happens to be. Figure 5 shows two examples of the <em>KryptonButton</em> control. The
top instance is the button in the normal state, the bottom instance shows the
button also in normal state but with both the <em>OverrideFocus</em> and
<em>OverrideDefault</em> applied.</p>
<p><em>Figure 5 – Overrides applied to the normal state</em></p>
<p><strong>Values</strong> </p>
<p>Many of the <em>Krypton</em> controls display information to the user. For example the
<em>KryptonButton</em>, <em>KryptonLabel</em> and <em>KryptonHeader</em> controls all have the
ability to show some text and/or an image as part of the appearance. This
display content is always stored in a property called <em>Values</em>. <em>Content</em> always
consists of two text values and an image that are grouped together. See Figure 1
for an example of the <em>Values</em> property for a <em>KryptonButton</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 6 – KryptonButton values property*</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact name of the three properties varies depending on the context in which
the content is being used. The <em>KryptonButton</em> calls them <em>Text</em>, <em>ExtraText,
Image and ImageStates</em> whereas the <em>KryptonHeader</em> uses the names <em>Header</em>,
<em>Description</em> and <em>Image</em>. Some controls have more than one content property.
The <em>KryptonHeaderGroup</em> control has two value properties that contain content
values, one of the primary header and another for the secondary header. Figure 7
shows the value properties for a <em>KryptonHeaderGroup</em>.</p>
<p><em>Figure 7 – Value properties for KryptonHeaderGroup</em></p>
<p><strong>Background, Border and Content</strong></p>
<p>Each <em>Krypton</em> control has a number of possible states that can each be
customized in appearance. Rather than have a completely different set of
customization properties for each control there are instead three standard sets
that help to improve consistency. The standard sets of values are for the
background, border and content.</p>
<p>Not every control will have all three sets as only the relevant ones are
provided. So the <em>KryptonPanel</em> only has the background set as it does not have
a border capability and does not display any content. The <em>KryptonLabel</em> has
only content properties and so the background and border are not provided. All
three are provided for the <em>KryptonButton</em> because it does have a background, a
border and content values.</p>
<p>Some controls will have extra values in addition to those in the three standard
sets as they have extra requirements that are control specific. But once you are
familiar with how the three standard sets are used to customize all aspects of
the control you will find it easy to deal with any of the <em>Krypton</em> controls.
Each of the three sets of properties are explained in detail in the following
section of the documentation.</p>
