<p><strong>Ribbon Values Properties</strong><br>Figure 1 shows a list of the <em>Values</em> category properties related to the ribbon
control. Following is a description of how to use each of the properties along
with relevant links to more detailed explanations.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 1 - Ribbon Values Properties*</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ButtonSpecs</strong><br>You can use the <em>ButtonSpecs</em> collection to add extra buttons onto the tab bar
of the ribbon. The tab bar is the area where tab headers and contextual tab
headers appear. This is a common requirement as many applications will want to
place a help button on the right side of the tab bar just like that present in
<em>Word 2007</em> and <em>Excel 2007</em>. You can get more details about using this property
at the following <a href="topic90.html">link</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>HideRibbonSize</strong><br>The ribbon control takes up quite a fair chunk of screen real estate and once
the user resizes the owning window down to a particular size it makes more sense
to hide the ribbon entirely. This property is used to determine at what height
and width the ribbon will automatically hide itself. Once the owning window is
resized bigger than this size then it will become visible again.  </p>
<p><strong>MinimizedMode</strong><br>By default the ribbon is fully visible but you can toggle the control into a
minimized mode in order to save space. The user can do this at runtime by double
clicking one of the tab headers or using the <em>CTRL + F1</em> key combination. Use
this property to toggle the mode using code or at design time.</p>
<p><strong>QATButtons</strong><br><strong>QATLocation</strong><br><strong>QATUserChange</strong><br>These three properties control the quick access toolbar that by default is
placed at the top of the ribbon control adjacent to the application button. You
would typically use the quick access toolbar for common actions that the user
always needs access to whatever tab is currently selected. For more information
about these properties using this link.</p>
<p><strong>RibbonAppButton</strong><br>The application button is the large round button that appears at the top left of
the ribbon control. This button is always displayed and when possible integrated
into the caption area of the owning <em>Form</em> instance. When using the ribbon you
should not use a menu or toolbar strip and so this button acts as the equivalent
of the <em>File</em> menu that would usually appear in a typical application. You can
get more details about the application button and these properties at the
following <a href="topic87.html">link</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>RibbonContexts</strong><br>If using contextual tabs in your application then you need to use this
collection property to define each of the different contexts required. Once you
have defined the contexts you should update the <em>ContextName</em> property of each
relevant tab to associate it with the appropriate context definition. Finally
update the <em>SelectedContext</em> property, described below, to define the currently
displayed context. For more information use the following <a href="topic86.html">link</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>RibbonShortcuts</strong><br>This is a compound property that has a set of child properties for defining
individual shortcuts. Update the child values in order to define which key
combinations are used to enter keyboard mode and to switch to/from minimized
modes.  </p>
<p><strong>RibbonStrings</strong><br>All display strings used by the control are placed inside this compound
property. This is important as it allows the developer to localize the text
strings for different languages by changing the form level culture. Most of the
strings inside this compound property related to the context menus that the
ribbon shows.  </p>
<p><strong>RibbonTabs</strong><br>This is the root property used to define individual tabs for the ribbon. As a
collection property you can use it to add/remove and update tab instances. Each
tab itself has a <em>Groups</em> property for defining the contents of the tab when it
is selected. For more detail use the following <a href="topic66.html">link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SelectedContext</strong><br>When using contextual tabs you use this property to define which contexts are
currently displayed. The value is a comma separated list of context names where
the contexts are displayed in the same order as they appear in the property. For
mode information use the following <a href="topic86.html">link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SelectedTab</strong><br>Use this property to define which of the displayed tabs should be the currently
selected tab. If you attempt to set a tab that is not possible to be displayed
then it will throw an exception.</p>
<p><strong>Ribbon Visuals Properties</strong><br>Figure 2 shows a list of the <em>Visuals</em> category properties related to the ribbon
control. Following is a description of how to use each of the properties along
with relevant links to more detailed explanations.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 2 - Ribbon Visuals Properties*</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AllowButtonSpecTooltips</strong><br>By default the Ribbon will not show any tool tips when you hover the mouse over
the user defined button specifications that appear on the tabs line of the
control. If you set this boolean property to <em>True</em> then it will turn on tool
tips for those button specs. Use the <em>ButtonSpec.TooltipText</em> property in order
to define the string you would like to appear inside the displayed tool tip.  </p>
<p><strong>AllowFormIntegrate</strong><br>Under <em>Vista</em> with the <em>Aero</em> theme enabled there are two choices for how the
ribbon integrates into the custom chrome of a <em>KryptonForm</em>. If you leave the
default value of <em>True</em> in place then it will show with glass chrome and have
the same appearance as <em>Office 2007</em> applications under <em>Vista</em>. Change this
property to <em>False</em> and you revert to the same appearance as under XP. Figure 3
shows the two settings, <em>True</em> on the left and <em>False</em> on the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure 3 - Ribbon Form Integration*</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AllowMinimizedChange</strong><br>Determines if the user is allowed to change the minimized mode of the ribbon at
runtime. They can do this using the keyboard combination <em>Ctrl+F1</em>, double
clicking a page header or by using one of the appropriate context menu options.
Set this property to False to prevent the user changing the mode. Note that this
property does not prevent programmatic changing of the <em>MinimizedMode</em> property.</p>
<p><strong>RibbonStyles</strong><br>This compound property contains a list of the different styles that can be
changed. For example you can change the background style from the default of
<em>Panel - Client</em> if you prefer a different background that is appropriate for
your application. Alternatively you could alter the display style of the group
buttons, cluster buttons or various other ribbon elements.</p>
<p><strong>Ten States</strong><br>As with all the <em>Krypton</em> controls, each possible state of the control has a set
of properties that can be used to customize the appearance. For the ribbon there
are ten possible states that various elements can be in but not all the elements
use all the states. The ten states are named <em>StateDisabled</em>, <em>StateNormal</em>,
<em>StateTracking</em>, <em>StatePressed, StateCheckedNormal, StateCheckedTracking,
StateContextCheckedNormal, StateContextCheckedTracking, StateContextNormal and
StateContextTracking</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Common State</strong><br>To speed up the customization process an extra <em>StateCommon</em> property has been
provided. The settings from this are used if no override has been defined for
the state specific entry. Note that the specific state values always take
precedence and so if you define a property in both the <em>StateNormal</em> and
<em>StateCommon</em> sets then the <em>StateNormal</em> value will be used whenever the
control is in the <em>Normal</em> state. Only if the <em>StateNormal</em> value is not
overridden will it look in <em>StateCommon</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Override State</strong><br>There is an additional state related property called <em>OverrideFocus</em> is used to
alter the appearance of the control when it has the focus. Notice that the
property starts with the <em>Override</em> prefix instead of the usual <em>State</em>. This is
because it does not relate to a specific control state such as <em>Normal</em> or
<em>Tracking</em>. Instead it is applied to any of the other states and is used to
override the appearance that would otherwise be shown.</p>
